Fetch and Display User Data (Task 7)
This project uses the JavaScript Fetch API with async/await to get user data from a public API, handle errors, and display the results dynamically.

ðŸ’» Code Summary
 * HTML: Sets up the container (#userDataContainer) and the reload button.
 * CSS: Styles the page, user cards, and the error message.
 * JavaScript:
   * Uses fetch('...') and await response.json().
   * Includes a try...catch block to handle network errors and non-OK HTTP responses.
   * Loops through the user array to create and append HTML card elements to the DOM.
   * Attaches the fetch function to the reload button's click event.
